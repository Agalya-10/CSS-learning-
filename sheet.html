<h5>Wild Animals & Domestic Animals</h5>
<p>The domestication of vertebrates is the mutual relationship between vertebrate animals including birds and mammals, and the humans who have influence on their care and reproduction.<br> Charles Darwin recognized a small number of traits that made domesticated species different from their wild ancestors</p>
<p>Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.<br> Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport.<br> Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. </p>
